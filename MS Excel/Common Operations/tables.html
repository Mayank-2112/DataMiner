                <h2 class="sub-heading">Create Table</h2>
                    To create a table in MS Excel, you can follow these steps:
                    <br><br>
                    <span>Step 1: Launch Microsoft Excel</span> <br>
                    Open Microsoft Excel on your computer. If you don't have Excel installed, you can download it from
                    the Microsoft Office website or explore alternative spreadsheet programs.
                    <br><br>
                    <span>Step 2: Select a Worksheet</span> <br>
                    Upon opening Excel, you'll be presented with a blank workbook. Choose the worksheet where you want
                    to create the table. You can either select an existing worksheet or create a new one by clicking on
                    the "+" button located at the bottom of the Excel window.
                    <br><br>
                    <span>Step 3: Define Your Data:</span> <br>
                    Identify the specific data you want to include in your table. For instance, let's assume you have a
                    list of employees and their corresponding information, such as names, departments, and salaries.
                    <br><br>
                    <span>Step 4: Enter Column Headers</span> <br>
                    In the first row of your chosen worksheet, enter the column headers that describe each category of
                    data. Following our example, input "Name" in cell A1, "Department" in cell B1, and "Salary" in cell
                    C1.
                    <br><br>
                    <span>Step 5: Input Data</span> <br>
                    Enter the relevant data for each column beneath their respective headers. Continuing with our
                    example, you would enter the name of the first employee in cell A2, their department in cell B2, and
                    their salary in cell C2. Repeat this process for each employee or data point you wish to include in
                    the table.
                    <br><br>
                    <span>Step 6: Select the Table Range</span> <br>
                    With all the data entered, select the entire range of your table, including the headers and all the
                    rows and columns. This can be done by clicking and dragging to highlight the range or by using the
                    keyboard shortcuts (e.g., Ctrl+A on Windows or Command+A on Mac) to select all cells in the
                    worksheet.
                    <br><br>
                    <span>Step 7: Insert the Table</span> <br>
                    Once your desired table range is selected, navigate to the "Insert" tab in the Excel ribbon at the
                    top of the window. Within the "Tables" group, locate and click on the "Table" button. A dialog box
                    will appear on the screen. 
                    <br><br>
                    <span>Step 8: Specify Table Range and Headers</span> <br>
                    In the dialog box, Excel will automatically detect the range you previously selected. Ensure that
                    the "My table has headers" checkbox is selected if your table includes column headers (which it
                    should). Finally, click the "OK" button to create the table.
                    <br><br>
                    <span>Step 9: Customize the Table</span> <br>
                    Excel will instantly transform your selected range into a table, applying formatting and adding
                    filter buttons to each column header. By default, the table will be assigned a name like "Table1" or
                    "Table2," but you can change this name by clicking on the table and editing it in the formula bar at
                    the top of the window. At this point, you can further format and customize your table using the
                    various options available in Excel's ribbon and context menus.

                <h2 class="sub-heading">Add row or column</h2>
                <p>
                    To add a row or column in MS Excel, you can follow these steps:
                    <br><br>
                    <span>Step 1: Launch Microsoft Excel</span> <br>
                    Open Microsoft Excel on your computer. If you don't have Excel installed, you can download it from
                    the Microsoft Office website or explore alternative spreadsheet programs.
                    <br><br>
                    <span>Step 2: Select a Table</span> <br>
                    Navigate to the worksheet that contains your desired table. Click anywhere within the table to
                    activate it. Excel will automatically detect the boundaries of the table
                    <br><br>
                    <span>Step 3: Adding a Row</span> <br>
                    To add a new row to the table, right-click anywhere within the table and select "Insert" from the
                    context menu. Alternatively, you can use the shortcut key combination "Ctrl" + "+" (plus) on Windows
                    or "Command" + "+" (plus) on Mac. Excel will insert a new row directly above the row where your
                    cursor was placed. <br><br>
                    <span>Step 4: Populate the New Row </span><br>
                    Enter the relevant data in each cell of the newly added row. Ensure that the data aligns with the
                    corresponding column headers and maintains consistency with the existing data structure.
                    <br><br>
                    <span>Step 5: Adding a Column</span><br>
                    To insert a new column into the table, right-click on any cell within the table and choose "Insert"
                    from the context menu. Alternatively, you can use the shortcut key combination "Ctrl" + "Shift" +
                    "+" (plus) on Windows or "Command" + "Shift" + "+" (plus) on Mac. Excel will insert a new column to
                    the left of the column where your cursor was located.
                    <br><br>
                    <span>Step 6:  Label the New Column </span><br>
                    Enter a suitable header for the newly added column in the topmost cell (header cell) of the column. The header should accurately represent the data category or information to be included in the column.
                    <br><br>
                    <span>Step 7: Populate the Column</span><br>
                    Fill in the relevant data in each cell of the newly inserted column, aligning it with the appropriate row data and maintaining consistency with the rest of the table.
                    <br><br>
                    <span>Step 8: Adjust Table Formulas (if necessary) </span><br>
                    If your table contains formulas that reference specific ranges or cells, you may need to adjust those formulas to incorporate the newly added rows or columns. Excel will often update the formulas automatically, but double-check to ensure accuracy.
                    <br><br>
                    <span>Step 9: Format and Customize </span><br>
                    Once the rows and/or columns have been added to your table, you can format and customize them further as needed. Excel provides various formatting options, such as changing font styles, applying colors, or adjusting column widths, to enhance the table's appearance and readability.

                <p>
                    To delete a row or column in MS Excel, you can follow these steps:
                    <br><br>
                    <span>Step 1: Select the Table</span> <br>
                    Open your Excel workbook and navigate to the worksheet containing the table you want to modify. Click anywhere within the table to activate it. Excel will automatically detect the boundaries of the table
                    <br><br>
                    <span>Step 2:  Deleting a Row</span> <br>
                    To delete a row from the table, right-click on the row you want to remove and select "Delete" from the context menu. Alternatively, you can use the shortcut key combination "Ctrl" + "-" (minus) on Windows or "Command" + "-" (minus) on Mac. Excel will delete the selected row, shifting the remaining rows up.
                    <br><br>
                    <span>Step 3:  Deleting a Column</span> <br>
                    To remove a column from the table, right-click on any cell within the column you want to delete and choose "Delete" from the context menu. Alternatively, you can use the shortcut key combination "Ctrl" + "Shift" + "-" (minus) on Windows or "Command" + "Shift" + "-" (minus) on Mac. Excel will delete the selected column, shifting the remaining columns to the left. <br><br>
                    <span>Step 4: Confirm the Deletion </span><br>
                    Excel will prompt you to confirm the deletion by asking if you want to shift cells up (for row deletion) or left (for column deletion). Make sure to choose the appropriate option based on how you want the remaining data to be repositioned.
                    <br><br>
                    <span> Step 5: Adjust Table Formulas (if necessary)</span><br>
                    If your table contains formulas that reference the deleted rows or columns, you may need to adjust those formulas to exclude the deleted data. Update the formulas to ensure they reflect the new structure of your table accurately
                    <br><br>
                    <span>Step 6:  Format and Customize </span><br>
                    After deleting the rows or columns, you can format and customize the table as needed. Excel offers various formatting options, such as changing font styles, applying colors, or adjusting column widths, to enhance the table's appearance and readability.
